Chrome DevTools, Inside Out
===========================
Chrome DevTools: a suite of tools to debug and profile the performance of your site. They're bundled with every copy of Chrome, and you have every reason to learn what they're capable of.

Starting with the basics of inspecting HTML and CSS, we will then tour debugging scripts line-by-line and profiling performance. We'll also find out the features that help you automate work and save time. If you've always wanted to know how to debug CSS and Javascript, this talk will help you demystify your code and not make things worse by guessin'.


Developing Developers
=====================
Software development is a young profession. Our career paths are still geared up to accept junior developers from academia, make them productive in a team, and then preparing them for a career in management. Technical skills and experience are often devalued in favour of developing new line managers and project managers.

We have a responsibility for developing the technical skills and experience of developers, for building a better profession and for creating a healthy environment to work in. How can we shape careers that challenge and value developers, and how do you identify and respond when things go wrong?

This talk will use my insights from building career paths from scratch at emerging companies, and examine the successes and failures that are common across the industry.

- A talk about creating career paths that reward and challenge developers, and prevent roles serving company pressures more than their aspirations.


Writing Modular Stylesheets with CSS Modules
============================================
Composition has long been a goal of CSS design. Creating a rich library of styles that can be reused and combined saves time in the long run, but often lead to unmaintainable or verbose code.

WebPack is commonly used for bundling JS modules, but its flexibility means it can also be used to load CSS Modules: local styles that can be imported and exported just like scripts.

This talk introduces WebPack and will demonstrate how to write, bundle and use CSS Modules. We'll also examine their benefits, and why they can help in ways other tools have failed in the past.

Writing JavaScript Stylesheets and Not Ending the World
============================================
styles.js: sounds wrong, doesn't it? But wait! Defining styles as JavaScript objects allows you to use, manipulate and insert them into your React components just like... JavaScript.

This talk looks at some of the tools that allow you to load JavaScript stylesheets, and how they add true modularity to CSS. We'll explore how this changes stylesheet design, and the freedom to call a button a .button instead of .search__button--hidden.

By the end of this talk, you will be able to set up the popular tool Radium, write styles modularly, and apply them to a React component. You'll also discover expressive features such as using maths in property values, dead code elimination and conditional styles.

Discovering Devops with Ansible
===============================
Do you fear that owning your own web server is reserved for the elite and all-powerful society of sysadmins? Then fear not, the fact is that it's never been easier.

Ansible is a powerful tool that lets you control servers by configuration instead of command. It's designed for ease-of-use, and this talk will show how installing software, automating tasks and setting up access control is managed using its simple YAML interface. We'll use these lessons to set up a basic website on a fresh server, and explain some of the fundamentals of hosting a site along the way.

You'll learn everything needed to set up your own host, and you'll discover the independence of doing it yourself.

- This talk is aimed at hosting beginners.
- I'd like to demonstrate Ansible's value as a learning tool. Its simple interface offers an alternative to mastering the command-line, and its config files record things that have been learned.
- The talk will features some command-line usage, but user-friendly tools will be the major theme.
- I want to demonstrate Ansible alongside other tools designed for ease-of-use, such as Digital Ocean and the Caddy webserver.
